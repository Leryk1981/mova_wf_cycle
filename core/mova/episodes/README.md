# core/mova/episodes – episode formats and notes

This folder is reserved for:

- the shared episode schema reference (`ds.episode_v1.schema.json` in `core/mova/ds/`),

- helper docs around the genetic layer.

All concrete episode documents in the lab (for example in `skills/<skill_id>/episodes/`)

must be valid against `ds.episode_v1.schema.json`.
