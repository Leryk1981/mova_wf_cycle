# core/mova/env – MOVA envelopes (red core)

This folder will contain shared `env.*` envelope schemas used across skills.

The MOVA 4.0.0 core catalog includes an envelope:

- `env.mova4_core_catalog_publish_v1` with verb `publish`.

In this bootstrap step we do not copy envelope schemas yet; we only

prepare the structure. Concrete `env.*` JSON Schema files will be

added in a separate task.
