# MOVA layer for skill.mova_lab_operator

This folder will contain local MOVA definitions for the lab operator skill:

- `ds/` – data schemas (to be added later if needed)

- `env/` – envelopes (to be added later if needed)

For now, the skill reuses shared core schemas:

- `ds.skill_descriptor_v1`, `ds.skill_registry_v1`, `ds.skill_runtime_binding_v1`

- `ds.episode_v1`, `ds.episode_policy_v1`, `ds.skill_run_request_v1`

- `env.skill_run_v1`
