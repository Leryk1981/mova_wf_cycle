# skill.context7_docs

Skill for working with the Context7 MCP server.

Purpose:

- Before starting work on a project or library,

  the skill calls Context7 and fetches up-to-date documentation

  and code samples.

- The result can be placed into a note or log, or shown

  to a human/agent as a “context pack before work.”

This skill:

- is described via `manifest.skill.json` (ds.skill_descriptor_v1),

- has an MCP binding to the official Context7 server,

- will later receive dedicated ds./env. schemas for request and response.
