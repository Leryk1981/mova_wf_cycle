# Episodes for `skill.runtime_binding_code_scaffolder_basic`

This folder will contain real execution episodes of the skill.

All episode documents here must be valid against the shared core schema:

- `core/mova/ds/ds.episode_v1.schema.json`

Note: The skill's `episode_policy` is set to `mode: "none"`, so episodes are typically not recorded automatically. They may be created manually for documentation purposes.
