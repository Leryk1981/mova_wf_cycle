# Operator checklist (station)

- Confirm target branch and status (`git status -sb`).
- Run `/station-quick` (or `/gates` if verification only).
- Capture gate results and quality suite outputs.
- Record artifacts path(s) from `artifacts/**`.
- Finish with `git status -sb` and `git diff --stat` if changed.
