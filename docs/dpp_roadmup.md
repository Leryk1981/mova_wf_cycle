# DPP roadmap (archive)

High-level milestones for the DPP lab work:
- Establish baseline schemas and envelopes for payload validation.
- Add smoke and soak flows to compare versions safely.
- Capture episodes and metrics for every change to keep regressions visible.

Use this as historical context; current work should reference the latest MOVA-aligned contracts.
