  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-09, after L3_02 dpp_passport_normalize_basic)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after implementing skill.dpp_passport_normalize_basic for single-record normalization using env.dpp_passport_normalize_run_v1 and producing lab_battery_passport_extended_v1 output. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── lab/{schemas/, env/, examples/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{dpp_passport_normalize_basic, mova_check_basic, repo_snapshot_basic, ...}\n├── docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/...\n└── core/mova/, spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L3_02)\n- Added `skill.dpp_passport_normalize_basic` (Node) with binding and manifest.\n- Normalization logic maps normalize_input_v1 to lab_battery_passport_extended_v1 (happy path).\n- Added run example/result and episode for the new skill.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Engine still basic; future iterations may add validation/derived fields.\n- Snapshot captures state after first runnable normalization engine.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; DPP L3_02 normalization engine added.\n- **Skill**: skill.dpp_passport_normalize_basic (local_script) consumes env.dpp_passport_normalize_run_v1 and emits lab_battery_passport_extended_v1.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L3_02_dpp_passport_normalize_basic recorded.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Extend engine with validation/derived fields in future L3 steps.\n"
