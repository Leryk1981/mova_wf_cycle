  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-09, after L3_01 DPP passport normalize contracts)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after adding lab schemas for DPP normalization input and run envelope, with examples and mova_check_basic validation. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{schemas/, env/, examples/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic, repo_snapshot_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L3_01)\n- Added lab schema `ds.dpp_passport_normalize_input_v1` (near-identity to extended passport input).\n- Added lab envelope `env.dpp_passport_normalize_run_v1` for normalization requests.\n- Added examples for input and run envelope; validated via `skill.mova_check_basic` (status: ok).\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Normalization engine implementation will follow in L3_02 (skill-level).\n- Snapshot captures repository state after L3_01 contracts.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; DPP L3_01 normalization contracts added.\n- **Schemas**: `ds.dpp_passport_normalize_input_v1`, `env.dpp_passport_normalize_run_v1` with examples.\n- **Validation**: mova_check_basic runs succeeded.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L3_01_dpp_passport_normalize_contracts recorded.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Use these contracts in the upcoming normalization skill (L3_02).\n"
