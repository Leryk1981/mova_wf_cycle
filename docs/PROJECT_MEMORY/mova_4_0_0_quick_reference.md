# MOVA 4.0.0 quick reference (archive)

Concise reminders for MOVA 4.0.0 usage:
- Red core schemas and envelopes are authoritative and read-only.
- Respect global vocabulary for roles, resources, states, and verbs.
- Use contract-first execution; skills rely on external runtimes rather than embedded logic.
