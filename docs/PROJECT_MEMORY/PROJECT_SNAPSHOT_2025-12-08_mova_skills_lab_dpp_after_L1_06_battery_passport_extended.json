  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-08, after L1_06 battery passport extended)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after adding the extended lab battery passport schema/example, running mova_check_basic on it, and capturing results. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{schemas/, skills_registry_v1.json, examples/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n├── tools/{validate_lab.js, run_skill_plan.js, record_episode.js, README.md}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L1_06)\n- Added `ds.lab_battery_passport_extended_v1` with required CF method/verification and cobalt traceability.\n- Added example instance `dpp_battery_passport_extended_example.json`.\n- mova_check_basic run (status warning): flags optional additional materials and optional external_sources requirement.\n- Snapshot captured after the update; indices refreshed.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Remaining gaps from mova_check_basic: only cobalt is modeled; external_sources is optional. Consider requiring more materials and at least one external source for pilots.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; extended battery passport added and checked.\n- **Schema**: CF method/verification required; materials.cobalt required; external_sources and regulation_tags supported.\n- **Result**: mova_check_basic warning about limited material scope and optional external_sources.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L1_06_battery_passport_extended recorded; core 4.0.0.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Decide on expanding materials coverage and requiring external sources.\n- [ ] Continue iterating mova_check_basic across DPP schemas."
