  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-08, after L1_07 DPP lab decisions deferred)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after introducing DECISIONS_DPP_LAB.md and logging deferred items (cobalt-only materials, external_sources optional) for the extended battery passport. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{schemas/, skills_registry_v1.json, examples/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n├── tools/{validate_lab.js, run_skill_plan.js, record_episode.js, README.md}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L1_07)\n- Added decision log `DECISIONS_DPP_LAB.md` with deferred items: cobalt-only materials model; external_sources optional.\n- Snapshot recorded to capture the decision state; indices updated.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Deferred items remain open for future phases (materials expansion, external_sources requirement).\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; decision log added for DPP lab.\n- **Decisions**: cobalt-only materials, external_sources optional — both deferred for later phases.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L1_07_dpp_lab_decisions_deferred recorded; core 4.0.0.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Revisit deferred decisions in future phases (materials expansion, external_sources requirement)."
