  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-08, after L2_01 DPP passport read workflow)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after introducing lab envelope `env.dpp_passport_read_v1` with public/manufacturer/verifier examples and running mova_check_basic on it. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{env/, examples/, schemas/, skill_runs/, tools/, skills_registry_v1.json}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic, memory_fetch_sqlite_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n├── tools/{validate_lab.js, run_skill_plan.js, record_episode.js}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L2_01)\n- Added lab envelope `env.dpp_passport_read_v1` for battery passport reads with view levels (public/manufacturer/verifier/technical).\n- Added three usage examples (public, manufacturer, verifier) referencing the extended passport sample.\n- Validated envelope via `skill.mova_check_basic` (status: ok).\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Snapshot captures repository state after L2_01 passport read workflow additions.\n- Continue using MOVA 4.0.0 as core; 4.1.0-draft only as guidance.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; DPP L2_01 passport read workflow added.\n- **Envelope**: `env.dpp_passport_read_v1` with role-based views (public/manufacturer/verifier/technical).\n- **Validation**: mova_check_basic run succeeded for the new envelope schema.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L2_01_dpp_passport_read_workflow recorded.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Reuse the new read envelope in downstream workflows (manufacturer/verifier portals) and memory fetch examples."
