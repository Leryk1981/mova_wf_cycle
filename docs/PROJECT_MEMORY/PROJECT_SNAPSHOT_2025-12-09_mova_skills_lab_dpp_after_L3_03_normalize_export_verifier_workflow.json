  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-09, after L3_03 normalize→export→verifier workflow)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after adding a lab-level integration workflow that chains normalization (skill.dpp_passport_normalize_basic) → export (env.dpp_export_v1) → verifier read (env.dpp_passport_read_v1). Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── lab/{examples/, skill_runs/, schemas/, env/, tools/}\n├── skills/{dpp_passport_normalize_basic, repo_snapshot_basic, mova_check_basic, ...}\n├── docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/...\n└── core/mova/, spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L3_03)\n- Added export and verifier envelopes tied to normalized passport (BAT-2025-NORM-001).\n- Added integration workflow example `dpp_workflow_L3_03_normalize_export_verifier_example.json` linking normalize→export→verifier.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Workflow is lab-level; execution handled by external services using referenced envelopes and skill runs.\n- Builds on L3_02 normalization engine and L2_02/L2_01 envelopes.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; DPP L3_03 integration workflow added.\n- **Workflow**: normalize input → export GS1 EPCIS → verifier read (single passport BAT-2025-NORM-001).\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L3_03_normalize_export_verifier_workflow recorded.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Use workflow example for integration tests in future steps.\n"
