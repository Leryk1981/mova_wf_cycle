  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-08, after L1_05 mova_check stronger minimal)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after tightening the minimal lab battery passport per mova_check_basic feedback (required manufacturing fields, materials, CF verification), re-running mova_check_basic, and capturing results. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{schemas/, skills_registry_v1.json, examples/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n├── tools/{validate_lab.js, run_skill_plan.js, record_episode.js, README.md}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L1_05)\n- Strengthened `ds.lab_battery_passport_minimal_v1`: manufacturing date/location required; materials required; CF verification_status required.\n- Re-ran `mova_check_basic` (status warning): materials/cobalt still optional; CF method optional.\n- Snapshot captured after the update; indices refreshed.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Remaining gaps flagged by mova_check_basic: enforce material blocks and CF method if needed for pilots.\n- Next: decide whether to require cobalt/material blocks and CF method; expand mova_check coverage to more schemas.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; strengthened lab battery passport minimal and re-ran mova_check_basic.\n- **Schema**: manufacturing date/location now required; materials required; CF verification_status required.\n- **Result**: mova_check_basic warning about optional cobalt block and optional CF method.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L1_05_mova_check_stronger_minimal recorded; core 4.0.0.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Decide on enforcing material blocks and CF method for pilots.\n- [ ] Continue iterating mova_check_basic cases on other DPP schemas."
