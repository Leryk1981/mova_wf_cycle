# MOVA AI Bootstrap Usage Patterns

## 1. General idea
`ds.mova_ai_bootstrap_pack_v1` is a contract-first bundle that tells an AI model how to behave as a MOVA 4.0.0 expert. The apply script (`lab/tools/mova_ai_bootstrap_apply_profile.js`) turns the pack into three ready-to-use artifacts: a system prompt, an assistant guide, and a checklist. Use the envelope `env.mova_ai_bootstrap_generate_v1` + skill `skill.mova_ai_bootstrap_generate_basic` to create a pack, then apply it to get the text blocks.

## 2. Chat UI (e.g. ChatGPT)
- `*.system_prompt.txt` → paste into the system/“instructions for assistant” field.
- `*.assistant_guide.md` → keep as a separate doc or pinned message for reference.
- `*.checklist.txt` → small ruleset to verify answers before trusting them.
Manual workflow: copy system prompt into ChatGPT instructions, keep guide/checklist open in a side note.

## 3. IDE Agent (VS Code / MOVA Workbench, Codex/Gemini/Qwen)
- System prompt → base agent config (extension settings / control layer).
- Assistant guide → render in a Markdown panel or pinned view for quick recall.
- Checklist → use as a “pre-flight” reminder (e.g., fixed panel at the bottom of the agent UI).

## 4. External orchestrator / CLI
- Runner reads `*.system_prompt.txt` and adds it to the LLM API request.
- `*.assistant_guide.md` stored as an artifact for operators.
- `*.checklist.txt` can be used for automatic linting of responses (e.g., verify required fields, no extra properties) or shown to human reviewers.

Artifacts are generated by:
```bash
node lab/tools/mova_ai_bootstrap_apply_profile.js \
  --pack lab/examples/mova_ai_bootstrap_pack.chatgpt_main.v1.json \
  --out-dir lab/generated/bootstrap/
```
