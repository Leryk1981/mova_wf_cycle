  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-09, after L2_03 manufacturer↔verifier workflow)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after adding a lab-level manufacturer→export→verifier workflow example using existing envelopes (env.dpp_passport_read_v1 and env.dpp_export_v1). Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{env/, examples/, schemas/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic, repo_snapshot_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L2_03)\n- Added lab workflow example `dpp_workflow_L2_03_manufacturer_verifier_example.json` linking manufacturer read → export (GS1 EPCIS) → verifier read.\n- Added optional documentation `docs/DPP_WORKFLOW_MANUFACTURER_VERIFIER_L2_03.md` describing the three steps and envelope references.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Workflow is lab-level; execution is handled by external services using the referenced envelopes.\n- Uses existing passport read/export envelopes from L2_01/L2_02.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; DPP L2_03 workflow example added.\n- **Workflow**: manufacturer→export→verifier using env.dpp_passport_read_v1 and env.dpp_export_v1.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L2_03_manufacturer_verifier_workflow recorded.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Reuse the workflow example in downstream automation (manufacturer/verifier portals)."
