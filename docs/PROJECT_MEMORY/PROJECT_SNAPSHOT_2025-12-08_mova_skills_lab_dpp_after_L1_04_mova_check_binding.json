  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-08, after L1_04 mova_check binding)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after wiring `skill.mova_check_basic` into the registry with an LLM binding, adding example envelopes for DPP schemas, and producing the first check result/episode. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{schemas/, skills_registry_v1.json, examples/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n├── tools/{validate_lab.js, run_skill_plan.js, record_episode.js, README.md}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L1_04)\n- `skill.mova_check_basic` registered with LLM binding (`mova_check_llm_binding_v1`).\n- Example envelopes for `env.mova_check_run_v1` on DPP schemas (battery passport minimal, regulation requirement).\n- First planned run executed via `run_skill_plan.js`; result recorded (status=warning) with suggestions to tighten required fields.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Binding is LLM-only; execution depends on profile `mova_check_profile.md`.\n- Next: add bindings for actual runtime execution or expand cases across more DPP schemas.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; mova_check_basic now in registry with LLM binding.\n- **Examples**: envelopes for battery passport minimal and regulation requirement schemas.\n- **Result**: first run produced warnings about optional manufacturing fields, non-required materials, and optional CF method/verification.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L1_04_mova_check_binding captured; core 4.0.0.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md and docs/00_INDEX.md.\n- [ ] Decide on runtime/binding extensions for real execution beyond LLM profile.\n- [ ] Expand mova_check_basic cases to other DPP schemas."
