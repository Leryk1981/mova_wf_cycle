# SmartLink 4.1.1 lab entry snapshot (2025-12-11)

Short snapshot for entering the SmartLink 4.1.1 lab track:
- Documents baseline, historical Codex candidate, and the active candidate directory.
- Notes the spec reference (`spec/mova-spec-4.1.1/`) and that it stays read-only.
- Points to WF_EX_010/WF_EX_011 configs and where to drop episodes/results.
