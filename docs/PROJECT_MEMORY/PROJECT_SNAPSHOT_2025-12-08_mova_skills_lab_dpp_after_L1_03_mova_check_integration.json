  "project_snapshot_md": "# MOVA Skills Lab — Project Snapshot (2025-12-08, after L1_03 mova_check integration)\n\n## 1. Overview\nState after wiring `skill.mova_check_basic` into the lab workflow: added to skills registry, prepared example envelopes for DPP schemas, planned first run, and captured L1_03 snapshot. Core remains MOVA 4.0.0; spec/mova-4.1.0-draft is reference only. Branch: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1.\n\n## 2. Structure (short)\n```\nmova_skills_lab/\n├── core/mova/{00_MANIFEST.json, ds/, env/, episodes/, global/, specs/}\n├── docs/{... , PROJECT_MEMORY/...}\n├── lab/{schemas/, skills_registry_v1.json, examples/, skill_runs/, tools/}\n├── skills/{... , mova_check_basic}\n├── spec/mova-4.1.0-draft/{docs/, examples/, schemas/, tools/}\n├── tools/{validate_lab.js, run_skill_plan.js, record_episode.js, README.md}\n└── package.json, package-lock.json\n```\n\n## 3. New in DPP (L1_03)\n- Registered `skill.mova_check_basic` in `lab/skills_registry_v1.json` (draft, no bindings yet).\n- Added example envelopes for validation: battery passport minimal schema and regulation requirement schema.\n- Planned first run via `run_skill_plan.js` (binding missing → plan only; execution pending binding), recorded an episode stub for tracking.\n- Snapshot captured after integration (this file) with indexes updated.\n\n## 4. Notes\n- Binding is not defined yet; mova_check_basic execution remains LLM-only and needs binding to run for real.\n- Next: add binding and real execution cases, extend coverage to more DPP schemas.\n",
  "global_memory_md": "- **Branch**: feature/dpp-base-pack-v0.1; integrated mova_check_basic into lab workflow.\n- **Registry**: skill.mova_check_basic added (draft, no bindings).\n- **Examples**: envelopes for ds.lab_battery_passport_minimal_v1 and ds.lab_regulation_requirement_v1.\n- **Run plan**: planned via run_skill_plan (binding missing → plan only); episode recorded.\n- **Snapshot**: dpp_after_L1_03_mova_check_integration captured; core 4.0.0, 4.1.0-draft reference.\n",
  "checklist_for_human": "- [ ] Add this snapshot to docs/PROJECT_MEMORY/00_INDEX.md (and docs/00_INDEX.md if listing snapshots).\n- [ ] Decide on binding/runtime for mova_check_basic to enable real execution.\n- [ ] Create real runs and outputs once binding is defined."
