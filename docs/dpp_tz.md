# DPP lab technical brief (archive)

This archived note summarizes the initial tech requirements for the DPP lab track:
- Use deterministic skills and schemas from MOVA core.
- Keep environment variables and secrets documented alongside run instructions.
- Prefer reproducible smoke/soak scripts before introducing new dependencies.

Any future DPP work should align with the latest MOVA specs and reuse the Skills Lab validation tooling.
