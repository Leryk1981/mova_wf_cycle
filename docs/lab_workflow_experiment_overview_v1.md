# Workflow experiment overview (v1)

This overview explains how workflow experiments are structured in MOVA Skills Lab.

## Purpose
- Compare baseline workflows against candidate variants generated by agents.
- Keep experiments deterministic and reproducible with clear metrics.

## Core elements
- **Procedures:** captured as `ds.lab_workflow_procedure_v1`.
- **Configs:** `ds.lab_workflow_experiment_config_v1` define participants, datasets, constraints, and metrics.
- **Episodes:** stored via `ds.lab_workflow_episode_data_v1`.
- **Results:** aggregated into `ds.lab_workflow_experiment_result_v1` with both numeric and narrative findings.

## Typical flow
1. Capture baseline procedure.
2. Generate candidate procedures per agent profile.
3. Run tasks against each candidate; record episodes.
4. Aggregate results and choose the best workflow (or merged variant).

## Metrics (baseline set)
- Time to complete (`total_time_minutes`).
- Iteration count (`iterations_count`).
- Errors after failed attempts (`errors_count`).
- Subjective load for the human operator (`subjective_load` 1–5).

## Constraints
- Avoid disruptive repo changes.
- Add dependencies only when required.
- Respect lab episode policies and existing scenarios.
