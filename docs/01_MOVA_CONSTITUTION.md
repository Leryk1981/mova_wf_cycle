# MOVA Skills Lab – MOVA Constitution (draft)

In this lab, MOVA 4.0.0 is treated as the red core:

- **Schemas (`ds.*`)** describe data structures.

- **Envelopes (`env.*`)** describe speech-acts over data.

- **Global** defines shared vocabularies (roles, resources, states).

- **Episodes** capture how envelopes were actually executed (genetic memory).

The primary machine-readable definition of the core is the MOVA 4.0.0 core catalog:

- Version: `4.0.0-core-draft-1`

- Catalog schema: `https://mova.dev/schemas/ds.mova4_core_catalog_v1.schema.json`

- Publish envelope id: `env.mova4_core_catalog_publish_v1`

This document is human-readable; the red core lives under `core/mova/`.
