# Lab Envelopes (Workflow Experiments)

- Green-layer envelopes for workflow experiment requests (`env.lab_workflow_*`).
- Follow MOVA 4.0.0 envelope style while staying outside the red core.
- Used to wrap lab payloads for planning, generating variants, running and aggregating workflow experiments.
