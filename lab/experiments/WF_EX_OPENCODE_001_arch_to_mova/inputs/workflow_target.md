Workflow Target
================
Domain: opencode
Title: arch_to_mova
Experiment: WF_EX_OPENCODE_001_arch_to_mova
Attempt: A_ide

Goal: Describe current OpenCode (sst/opencode) architecture as-is in MOVA terms (components/flows/interfaces/controls/artifacts), using only repo evidence.
Scope: read-only analysis of tmp/external/opencode + its docs; produce MOVA mapping docs inside this experiment folder.
No-Go: no code execution inside opencode; no secrets; no network except git clone already done; no modifications under tmp/external/opencode.
