# Lab (green layer)

This folder is a playground for experiments that are not yet

stabilized into proper skills.

Typical content:

- `notebooks/` – scenario notes and scratch experiments.

- `tmp/` – raw indexes, temporary JSON files (not episodes).

- `agents/` – LLM scenario drafts for Claude / Gemini / etc.

For now we only keep this README and leave the tree empty.
